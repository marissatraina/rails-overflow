## Summary

We're going to build a rails application from the ground up: a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) clone.  The goal of this challenge is to build a well-structured rails application with a good mixture of front-end and back-end features.  Focus on defining clear routes, creating clean templates, and enhancing your application with AJAX.  Before we jump in, peruse StackOverflow to understand its core features.
